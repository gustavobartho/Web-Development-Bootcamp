* States
    The UI is a function of the app's State - UI = f(State)
    UI changes are reflecting the changes in the state
    Declarative Programming - We declare how the UI should look under different conditions dependent upon the state

    * Hooks - Functions that allow us to hook into the state of the app and read or modify it
        - useState() -> Returns an array with two elements, the first one is the state variable and the second is the state changing function
        const [stateVar, setStateVar] = useState()
